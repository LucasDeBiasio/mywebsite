    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Lucas and welcome to my drastically oversimplified website.</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p style="display: inline-block;"> <-- me.</p>
    </div>
    <p>I am fourth year Computer Engineering student at Simon Fraser University. I am not a great student but I do my best. I enjoy challenging myself to do new things. Currently I am a full time student looking or a co-op opportunity for the fall of 2024. I am hoping to get a software engineering position as that is the field I think I want to work in. I enjoy coding for pleasure more than doing coursework. I want to make cool projects that I enjoy using on the daily, yet I have a hard time working out exactly what I want to build. Outside of school I like to go outside and stay active.</p>
